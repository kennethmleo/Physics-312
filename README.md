# Physics-312
Advanced Mathematical Physics II

Selected topics in topology, differential geometry, and related areas of mathematics that are important in contemporary theoretical physics
Course requirements:
Journal / notebook - 75%
Your journal shall include key discussion points, ideas, thoughts, codes, results, and pitfalls that you’ve encountered in Physics 312. It is expected that you will be building this notebook during the semester. I recommend using Quarto [[ https://quarto.org/docs/guide/ ]] as authoring tool.
Report - 25%
You will pick a specific problem (not a novel one, please) and discuss a solution using the methods we’ve discussed in class. The discussion will include what is the main issue, an overview of options, why you picked a specific option, key results and concerns. The report should be posted in the ⁠reports channel in a thread that you'll create. Populating this channel should begin after the deadline for filing LOA. There's a two-week period where comments from everyone in the class are most welcome.
